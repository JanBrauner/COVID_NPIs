### Generating GLEAM scenarios
# All combinations of groups and traces are created.
#
# Group and trace `name` values must contain all the classes in the
# parameters configuration sheet of that type. Groups and traces listed
# here that have no configuration will still be computed, but only with
# the parameters common to all classes of that type.
scenarios:
  # This will be the simulation name prefix in GLEAMviz. The full name
  # of each simulation will be "{name} ({group.name} + {trace.name})"

  # These are the different tabs you can click on to see different
  # charts.
  groups:
    - group: "Default_Weak"
      name: Weak mitigation
      description: Mostly open borders; full opening of public places; no social distancing; little compliance with hygiene advice

    - group: "Default_Moderate"
      name: Moderate mitigation
      description: Some border closure; closure of schools; ban on public gatherings; partial social distancing

    - group: "Default_Strong"
      name: Strong mitigation
      description: Strong external and internal border closure; full closure of public places (including places of worship); social distancing outside and within homes

    - group: "Default_Recommended"
      name: Recommended mitigation
      description: Moderate measures + compulsory masks; contact tracing; social distancing at places of worship and within homes

  # be added to the simulations as seeds.
